            <p>Hello! Starting my travel blog with Japan! This was actually a couple years ago. Starting in Tokyo, I was amazed at
            the thoughtful city planning that combined technology with nature into a unique collection of structures. As a tourist,
          I found it relatively easy to navigate the subway systems and I believe google maps worked pretty well for the most part.
        First plan of action was where and what to eat, after walking around City Hall and seeing some promos for the 2020 Olympics(it was 2018).
      My family and I ventured to Tsukiji Market to see the fish market in action. However, by the time we arrived, the markets had closed
    for the day as they start their tuna auctions very early :/ at 6am plus there was an old and new market. (Spoiler, they also reloacated around 2019)
    But where did all the fish go?</p>

            <p>Yep, sushi restaurants around the market got first dibs and would be serving them in time for lunch. After walking
            around an empty market, we got hungry and walked around Tsukiji Outer Market in search of food.
            I found a sushi spot that was pretty popular plus if they get their fish fresh everyday, it had to
          show in the taste right? This was actually a spot I had researched before, but the restaurant was already drawing a crowd at 10:30-11am.
        Tsukiji Yamato Sushi was bustling and we lucky got a seat at the sushi bar. There were many options to order individual pieces of fish/sushi
      however they were all in Japanese. The sushi chef who was used to tourist recommended the omakase, which consist of the special fish for today. Also
    means "to entrust", so we trusted the sushi chef. He was funny and wanted to show us how Japanese eat sushi and drink their miso soup. Both of which
  I thought I was pretty familiar with, but this sushi was special. I looked for the wasabi as I usually mix it with my soy sauce and dip the sushi in.
He understood what we said but recommended that we try it how he crafted it first. In addition, there would be no need of soy sauce or wasabi because he
blended the perfect amount on the fish already. The omakase went from leaner fish (tuna, salmon, shrimp) to fattier ones (uni, fatty salmon, and albacore), with ginger to
cleanse the palette in-between. Would definitely recommend you to trust the sushi chef to recommend to you in Tsukiji!</p>

              <p>The next day was time for Ginza! Ginza is one of the up-scale shopping areas that is nice to visit on a slower day. One of the
                unique shops I visited was the largest Uniqlo store, a whole 12 floors with special tees displayed and sold on one of the top floors. After
              walking around, I tried to find <a href="https://tempura-abe-ginza.gorp.jp/">Tempura Abe Ginza</a>, which was actually two floors below me as
            I looked around the whole street and wondered if it even exists. I was greeted with a pretty expensive menu (dinner) and was unsure, but finally
          decided that we had to try it. At the time, they just opened so there was no wait, but I believe reservations are needed now. The set was accompanied by
        different salts, kelp soup, and a radish side dish that must have been a palette cleanser. The plating and cups were traditional ceramics accompanied by their signature on the placing mat. Each vegatable or seafood item
        was individually fried and plated with their exact expertise. The tempura chefs even repositioned the food to give it the right look when a mini crab looked shifted. I enjoyed the tempura tomato
         and baby shrimps the most as they were perfectly crunchy and balanced. Overall, it is a relaxing experience and a light meal that leaves you
    plenty of room to eat late night snacks at Togoshi Ginza Shotengai!</p>

              <p>Who knew you could go fishing in Tokyo? This restaurant was also underground and felt like I walked into a mini cave to fish.
              The eat you own catch restaurant was called Zauo, pretty popular in Tokyo with several locations. When you walk in it feels like one of those fishing games but irl.
            You prepare to catch you fish. First, you want to pick the correct pond to fish out of and rent a pole. Then you can target your fish and throw the baited hook in. The pond had many different fish, so
          try to be precise with your placement. Bite! Then reel it in! The fish you catch will be the one they prepare. Then incoming drums to celebrate your catch. The fish have their individual prices along with
        prices to prepare them different ways. I picked the sashimi style and they used the bones to prepare a soup!. It is pretty interesting to see that you just ate the fish that you caught only ten minutes ago.
      They sliced it up and I enjoyed the sashimi style over having it cooked/fried. However, a couple side dishes would have been nice, but the fish itself costs a good amount already. There were many local families that
    go there for celebrations like their kid's birthday and it was fun to watch others catch their food too! Would definitely go back to try different fishies with an attack plan, because some of the
  exclusive fish are one in pond.</p>
