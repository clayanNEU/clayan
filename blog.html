              <h3>Summer Around Boston</h3>
              <p>It is now summer as I am writing this! Summer classes in Boston (NUTerm for the freshman) is a great time to get
              catch up with classes and exploring the rest of Boston. The Fens are home to the geese family and of course the Red Sox.
            Boston's Chinatown and Seaport are especially busy as people get out around May to early June to enjoy a warm summer before
          the humidity hits. Take advantage of summer programs at NEU like Boston hop-on/off bus tours that give you a better sense
        of the city and you can revisit those sites later. Or take a weekend to stop by New York, but I have to warn you the bus ride there
      is almost as long as the time you can spend there. Lastly, when you find yourself back in Boston, the Freedom Trail is also a great route
    to follow and it can be a throwback to you U.S. History/Democracy classes. And if you aren't sweating from the weather, intramural sports
  like frisbee or beach volleyball are nice to pick up!</p>

            <h3>Spring Breakthrough in Boston</h3>
            <p>Spring comes through, signaling the end of a chilly first winter. Cooped up
              inside for a while, to dodge the storms and cold, it is now perfect weather to get back outside! NEU makes a consistent
              effort to maintain the plants and flowers around campus, as an arboretum with over 143 species and a lot of trees. Rabbits
              also enrolled in spring semester and can be found hopping around and nibbling on the lawns. Meanwhile, midterms and finals come by
              very quickly and people are back to studying, but now you can read outside in the warm sun and fresh air.

              <h3>La Bufadora</h3>
              <p>During winter break, I was able to visit Mexico on a cruise! Ensenada is a nice coastal city in Baja California.
              It had a history of serving as the capital before the Mexican Revolution and is now a popular fishing, army, and tourist port.
            La Bufadora is the a deep cave/blowhole that shoots water up during high tide. You can even hear the water rush into the cave as a salt water mixture
          blown up against the rocky shores.</p>

              <h3>New Face!</h3>
              <p>I decided to go to a couple dance workshops (hosted by ASU) with my friends. Learning choreography was especially fun with the encouraging group of people there.
                In addition, Dance4Me was a charity dance competition where many cultural clubs with all experience levels took part in. I always looked forward to practice,
                even though I was pretty nervous/excited? leading up to the performace. We learned the dance to <em>New Face</em>
               by PSY! It was a really energizing k-pop song and fun to perform and have the audience smiling and cheering &#128522;. Shoutout to the chroreographers and
             everyone who made it happen.</p>

              <h3>Winter Arrives</h3>
              <p>You know it is winter when the first snow falls and it gets dark real early.
              This was the first snow I have seen in a long while and it was almost mesmerizing.
            I had seen snow in Canada, but this was incredibly fluffy and almost dry, not like sleet/rain.
          I remember I was practicing for a Dance4Me, a charity dance showcase with the Asian Student Union that day. I was wearing running shoes,
        and the snow was a nice surprise that we all stopped practice for a while to admire it coming down. After practice, I went to sit and take in
      the snow, ran around in it, and invited my roomate who also practiced to have a snowball fight. The snow was perfecty powdery, so it was like throwing
    dust.</p>

            <h3>Fall in Boston</h3>
            <p>Leaves dry up to many calming and colorful shades. Starts to get a little colder as the crisp,
            air cools down the summer. I have only seen this classic fall scenery from other pictures. Great time to walk
          around campus and Fenway Park. This year had little rain or wind, so the leaves stayed up for a good
        amount of time too!  That's two seasons through already. Brown, red, and yellow leaves fill the sidewalks and have a nice
      crunch as I like to step on them.</p>

              <h3>Off to College</h3>
              <p>Headed to Boston! Mid-sized city with lots to explore. Got a chance during the summer to take a run along the Charles River.
              Nice open space and view of what I think is Cambridge. Cool of along the Charles as it is actually 66% safe to swim in, not that
            I did, but was thinking about it in the hot 90 degree Boston Summer. Off to see the Northeastern Campus, with their newest building,
          ISEC, which provides an expansive space for research, classes, and cool spiral stairs. Apparently its LEED Gold certified and looks like
        a spaceship from the outside. Certainly feels like on when you enter.</p>

              <h3>Back to Nature</h3>
              <p>During winter break, I was able to walk Land's End with a friend and see the nice sunset backdop.
              It was an unplanned trip, and the weather was unlike the typical fog in the area, which made it even nicer. The trail leads
            to a great view of the Golden Gate Bridge and crashing waves below. About a mile or two into the trail, you can even find a
          maze made from stones that I actually think is pretty cool considering its been there for a long time. Along the way, I bumped into another
        friend coincidentally along the same path, highly unlikely but I guess San Francisco has its cool spots. </p>
