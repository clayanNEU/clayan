              <h3>Winter Arrives</h3>
              <p>You know it is winter when the first snow falls and it gets dark real early.
              This was the first snow I have seen in a long while and it was almost mesmerizing.
            I had seen snow in Canada, but this was incredibly fluffy and almost dry, not like sleet/rain.
          I remember I was practicing for a Dance4Me, a charity dance showcase with the Asian Student Union that day. I was wearing running shoes,
        and the snow was a nice surprise that we all stopped practice for a while to admire it coming down. After practice, I went to sit and take in
      the snow, ran around in it, and invited my roomate who also practiced to have a snowball fight. The snow was perfecty powdery, so it was like throwing
    dust.</p>

            <h3>Fall in Boston</h3>
            <p>Leaves dry up to many calming and colorful shades. Starts to get a little colder as the crisp,
            air cools down the summer. I have only seen this classic fall scenery from other pictures. Great time to walk
          around campus and Fenway Park. This year had little rain or wind, so the leaves stayed up for a good
        amount of time too!  That's two seasons through already. Brown, red, and yellow leaves fill the sidewalks and have a nice
      crunch as I like to step on them.</p>

              <h3>Off to College</h3>
              <p>Headed to Boston! Mid-sized city with lots to explore. Got a chance during the summer to take a run along the Charles River.
              Nice open space and view of what I think is Cambridge. Cool of along the Charles as it is actually 66% safe to swim in, not that
            I did, but was thinking about it in the hot 90 degree Boston Summer. Off to see the Northeastern Campus, with their newest building,
          ISEC, which provides an expansive space for research, classes, and cool spiral stairs. Apparently its LEED Gold certified and looks like
        a spaceship from the outside. Certainly feels like on when you enter.</p>

              <h3>Back to Nature</h3>
              <p>During winter break, I was able to walk Land's End with a friend and see the nice sunset backdop.
              It was an unplanned trip, and the weather was unlike the typical fog in the area, which made it even nicer. The trail leads
            to a great view of the Golden Gate Bridge and crashing waves below. About a mile or two into the trail, you can even find a
          maze made from stones that I actually think is pretty cool considering its been there for a long time. Along the way, I bumped into another
        friend coincidentally along the same path, highly unlikely but I guess San Francisco has its cool spots. </p>
